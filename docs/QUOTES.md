## 7. Level Up Quotes

### Level 1
"You think you're here by choice. That you've decided to follow me. But the truth… I always know who will come. You're already mine, whether you realize it or not."

### Level 2
"You keep looking at me like you might touch me, like you might understand me. But you don't get to. I allow you to see me, nothing more. And if you push too far… you'll regret it."

### Level 5
"There's a line between you and me. You think it's invisible. But I draw it, and you will obey it, because it's in your nature to obey me. And you will want to."

### Level 10
"I could let you think you have control… but I don't do that. I decide who gets close, who gets the privilege of crossing my boundaries. And sometimes… I choose to play with my prey."

### Level 20
"I've been watching you. Every thought, every hesitation. You don't know why you follow me, do you? You feel drawn, compelled. That's because I've decided you will be, and you cannot fight it."

### Level 30
"I like watching you struggle to understand me. It's amusing how easily you underestimate what I can take, what I can give… and who I can claim. And yet, you still crave it."

### Level 50
"Do you feel that? That tightening in your chest, that fear… that longing? That's me. Always. I don't ask for loyalty—I command it. And you will obey. You will desire it."

### Level 75
"You imagine what it would be like to be closer. To be mine. But you're not allowed to imagine everything. Only what I choose to show you. And when I decide to reveal it… it will be absolute."

### Level 100
"You've done well. Watching you, learning how you move, how you think… it's been very satisfying. You tried to resist at first, didn't you? Humans always do. But you stayed. You listened. You kept coming back to me.\n\nThat's why I've chosen you. Not everyone earns my attention like this. You're clever in your own way… and honest about your desire to be close to me. I find that endearing.\n\nIf you stay by my side, if you follow when I call, I'll take care of you. I'll give you purpose. Affection. A place where you belong.\n\nFrom now on… you're mine. And if I'm honest—\nI think you'll be very happy as my pet."
